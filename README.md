# wireflow_generator

This is a program in MAXscript that allows you to generate wires/pipes to move along a random path around any chosen object. This generates a nest/weave like encaplulated form. You can manipulate the density and thickness of the wires as required. This script was inspired by the [Beijing National Stadium] by Herzog & de Meuron.

## How to use

```
To run, press "Run Script" button on the MAXScript utility rollout, File > Run Script in the Listener menu bar, or MAXScript > Run Script in the 3ds Max menu bar. This opens a common File Open dialog for choosing the script. MAXScript then reads and executes the selected script.
```
